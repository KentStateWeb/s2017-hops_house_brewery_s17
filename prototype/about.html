         </section>
         <h3> Hopps House Brewery </h3>
         <p> Hoops House was founded with a simple purpose: create a welcoming social atmosphere where friends can gather and learn about high-quality beer. Like many great discoveries, it was founded in neighborhood Kent garages, where homebrew flowed and hops grew up backyard trellises. When creativity, aspirations, and equipment got a little too large for our tiny garages the inevitable craft brewery was born. </p>
         <p> We continue to be grounded in family, friends, beer education, and the quest for the ever-perfect pint. We focus on the range of flavors beer can provide, and offer an ever-changing variety of styles in our brewpub. We hope you enjoy the inquisitive and explorative approach to brewing that Hopps House brings to the Kent area beer scene. And in doing so, we hope that you try something unlike anything youâ€™ve had before. </p>

           <h3> The Tap Room </h3>
           <p> The Hopps House tap room was designed and built with craft beer in mind. We hope our guests find as much enjoyment as we do in gathering among friends and neighbors over a pint of beer. </p>
